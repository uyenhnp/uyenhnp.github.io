The purpose of this project is to build a database and present the business distribution around George Mason University (4400 University Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030). From that, students at GMU can choose their favorite restaurants convenient for them or match with their hobbies.

The project is implemented as following:
- Data collection: retrieve business data using Yelp Fusion API & Google Maps API (Python).
- Relational Database Design (MySQL)
\- Design a conceptual schema using the ER diagram.
\- Translate the ER diagram to relational tables.
\- Create a relational database and populate data into the database.
\- Query the database to perform data analysis.
-  Data visualization: create dashboards (Tableau).

In this project, we would like to target the scientific question of predicting Airbnb listing prices in New York city using other information about a listing such as location (GPS coordinates, neighbourhood), number of reviews, number of listings its host has, whether it is shared space, its availability throughout the year, etc. Our project objective is to figure out the major factors that influence the price of a listing and whether there exists any interesting patterns that allow us to know more about the renting market in New York city. We plan to achieve this goal by applying statistical learning methods to predict listing prices and explore the important features that have significant effects.

Traffic accidents are causing a substantial amount of unnecessary deaths and injuries every year in the United States. Having a better understanding about the leading causes that contribute to vehicle crashes on road is a very important step towards reducing the occurrence of these unfortunate events. In this paper, we investigate the most common reasons that lead to traffic accidents in the Town of Cary (North Carolina) in particular, and then generalize our findings to the entire US country in general. Through our analysis, we effectively show the following interesting observations:  
(1) COVID-19 pandemic substantially reduced traffic congestion as well as vehicle crashes on road during 2020 compared to prior years.  
(2) The most common reasons that have led to crashes is due to drivers’ carelessness and ignorance of their own vehicle conditions.  
(3) Most traffic accidents occur in the afternoon during rush hour, and very few accidents occur at night but most of them are fatal.  
(4) Taxicab has the highest crash percentage during bad weather condition, which is possibly due to tax drivers are often in a rush.  
(5) Vehicle crashes often happen in dark lighting condition on two-way roads without medians separating the two traveling sides.
