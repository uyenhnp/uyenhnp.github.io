In this project, we would like to target the scientific question of predicting Airbnb listing prices in New York city using other information about a listing such as location (GPS coordinates, neighbourhood), number of reviews, number of listings its host has, whether it is shared space, its availability throughout the year, etc. Our project objective is to figure out the major factors that influence the price of a listing and whether there exists any interesting patterns that allow us to know more about the renting market in New York city. We plan to achieve this goal by applying statistical learning methods to predict listing prices and explore the important features that have significant effects.
